    <h1>A Few Things About Myself</h1>
   <i><p>My name is Rita Ojoh, and I come from a family of seven. I am the fourth child. <br>I had older siblings to look up to, which helped me achieve a lot 
    in life. I studied <br>Chemical Engineering, which led me to my current career and I have grown to <br>become the team lead in my unit.</p>
<p>I love to provide solutions to people, listen to their problems and find the right <br>approach to assist them. This has made me excel in my job as I
    engage clients <br>on a regular basis and resolve whatever complaints they may have.</p> 
<p>During my free time, I love to hang out with friends, try new restaurants, or <br>invite friend over and make something nice for them. Also, I love to
    dance, <br>cook, travel solo, and enjoy watching movies indoors. As much as I love to <br>hang out with friends, I enjoy having my quiet time and in something
    cases, <br><em><strong>I look forward to having it.</strong> </em></p> 
<P>When I was much younger, my favorite colors were green and purple. Currently, <br>I am into black color and I recently realised that I have a lot of black clothes <br>and shoes (lol).
    I love black because it fits my complexion and makes me feel <br>confident. <br><img src="pic.jpg" width="200" height=" 300" alt="">  </P>

<p> Thank you.</p>
